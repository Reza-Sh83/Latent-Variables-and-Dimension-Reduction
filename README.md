# Latent Variables & Dimension Reduction in CS & Bioinformatics

## üìù Description

This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth exploration of latent variables and dimensionality reduction techniques, with a special focus on their applications in Computer Science and Bioinformatics. The notebook combines theoretical explanations, mathematical derivations, and practical Python implementations to illustrate key concepts.

It covers:
* **Latent Variables**: Definition, examples (e.g., disease state in gene expression, principal components in PCA), common uses in graphical models (HMMs, Bayesian Networks), GMMs, and Autoencoders/VAEs, along with their benefits.
* **Bioinformatics Examples**: Applications in gene regulatory networks, scRNA-seq (t-SNE, UMAP), HMMs for DNA (gene prediction), and protein structure prediction (VAEs).
* **Evaluation Methods**: Statistical patterns (PCA, factor analysis), perturbation methods, EM algorithm, Bayesian inference (MCMC), and deep learning (Autoencoders).
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Motivations (curse of dimensionality, noise reduction, visualization) and key methods in bioinformatics (PCA, LDA, t-SNE, UMAP, Autoencoders).

The notebook features detailed explanations and Python implementations for:
1.  **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Including the algorithm steps (data collection, standardization, covariance matrix, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, selection of principal components) and a Python implementation using `scikit-learn` on the breast cancer dataset.
2.  **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: Explaining its mechanism for capturing nonlinear relationships (pairwise similarities in high and low dimensions, KL divergence minimization) and a Python implementation using `scikit-learn` on the breast cancer dataset.
3.  **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)**: Detailing its graph-based approach for dimensionality reduction and a Python implementation using the `umap-learn` library on the breast cancer dataset.

Finally, the notebook offers a comparison of PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP, guidance on when to use each method, and a concluding summary of their importance in simplifying complex biological data.
